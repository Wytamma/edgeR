# edgeR-wasm

This is a WebAssembly (WASM) compatible version of the edgeR package for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data. The original package had an incompatible dependency on the `locfit` package.

If you can see a wasm build of `locfit` here -> [https://andyliaw-mrk.r-universe.dev/locfit](https://andyliaw-mrk.r-universe.dev/locfit)then you can probably install the original edgeR package and ignore this package.
